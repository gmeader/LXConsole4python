LXConsole|Python v 0.3
The command line has been enhanced in v0.3, but is still very basic.
Commands are initiated by pressing <return> except in the case where two digits are entered as a level.  100% is entered using the "f" key.

Set channel level:  a="@", t=">", f="@100", x="@0"
		channel@level
		channel>channel@level
		channel,channel@level
		channel,channel,channel...@level
   
Record a cue:	r="record "
		record cueNumber
		
Set current cue:	q="cue "
		cue cueNumber
Show all cues:
		cue ?
      
Set fade time:	t="time "
		time xfade
		time up down
		time up down follow
		time up waitup down waitdown
		time up waitup down waitdown follow
   
Patch address to channel:	p="patch "
		patch address channel
		patch address channel level
		patch address channel level option

Set Dimmer option:			P="dimmer_option"
		dimmer_option address option
		dimmer_option address option level
	
Dimmer options are 0=normal, 1=non-dim, 2=always on, 3=no-master

Show patch:
		patch ?
Show Dimmer Options:
		dimmer_option ? 
		
Set OSC message:	o="osc "
		osc message
		(message format: ip:port~addressPattern)
Show all OSC messages:
		osc ?

Examples:
            Set channel 20 to full: <2><0><f>
        Set chanels 1 to 10 at 50%: <1><t><1><0><a><5><0>
     Set chanels 1, 3 and 5 to 75%: <1><,><3><,><5><a><7><5>
  Set the time of cue 5 to 10 secs: <q><5><t><1><0><return>

Note: setting the current cue with the 'cue' command does two things.
First time commands always apply to the current cue.  Second, the
'cue' command does not put that cue into the output.  But, it does
cause that cue to be the next executed by the Go button.

OSC messages can be sent when a cue is executed.  The format for
defining an OSC message is ip:port~address.  For example, 
osc 10.110.1.2:53000~/cue/1/start would set the OSC message such
that it would tell QLab running on a machine with the IP address
10.110.1.2 to start cue one when the current cue is run.

Typing "o" and pressing return will clear the OSC message from the
current cue.

File Menu:
  Open opens a USITT ascii file
  Save saves a USITT ascii file
  Exit quits the application

Live Menu:
  OSC toggles OSC input.

Window Menu:
  Cues shows a liet of the recorded cues. (same as cue ? command)
  Patch shows the current patch. (same as patch ? command)
	
Application Options:
  Including the number of dimmer and channels, the target address
  for ArtNet output, and the port to listen on for OSC input are
  defined in the lxconsole.properties file.  This file is read when
  the application starts.
